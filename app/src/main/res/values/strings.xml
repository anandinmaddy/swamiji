    <string name="discourse_title"><b>The Spiritual Journey of H H Swami Paramarthananda Saraswathi</b></string>
    <string name="discourse_content">Swami Paramārthānanda was born on 18-05-1953 to Subramania Iyer and Parvathy in Palakkad, Kerala. He grew up with three older siblings and had his early schooling and college education in Palakkad, his home town. \n \n

In the year 1976 Swamiji joined a three year course in Vedānta offered by his Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati at Sandeepany Sadhanālaya, Mumbai.  There, he studied Sanskrit and the Sastras like the Bhagavadgītā, principal Upaniṣads, Brahmasūtras and several Prakaraṇagranthas.  After the completion of his course he moved to Chennai as a Brahmachāri on the directive of his Guru and started teaching Vedānta. He received Sannyāsa from his Guru in the year 1984 and continues to live in Chennai and teach at various centres in the city. \n \n

Over the last four decades Swamiji has systematically given public classes in English on several texts in Vedānta; ie Bhagavadgītā, principal Upaniṣads, Brahmasūtras and  Prakaraṇagranthas like Pañcadaśī, Naiṣkarmyasiddhi, Upadeśasāhasrī and several more.  Swamiji’s methodology of teaching involves communicating in English the essence of every Sanskrit verse in a text.  He has also conducted classes in Sanskrit. Over these several years his public classes have been recorded and documented with care. These recordings are very useful for those who cannot physically attend his lectures.
